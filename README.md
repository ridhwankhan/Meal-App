# test_project

A new Flutter project.

My project during my residential semester at TARC. 
This is a simple meal app where you can see food details along with the receipe in one place. 

Upcoming updates:
    - faster and smoother experience 
    - UI updates 
    - adding wishlist for receipe 
    - User input for foods 
    - social networkign (you can get stars by other users and get a fan base of yours)
