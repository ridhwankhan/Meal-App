## 🌟 Project Overview: Modern Mobile Development

The **Meal App** is a meticulously crafted, cross-platform mobile application built with **Flutter**. It serves as a comprehensive recipe browser, demonstrating proficiency in advanced state management, complex filtering logic, and delivering a robust user experience.

This project is a showcase of building modular, maintainable, and high-performance applications using the modern Flutter ecosystem.

### 📱 Preview 


This application showcases specific technical competencies vital for a professional role:

* **Advanced State Management (Riverpod):** Implemented predictable and testable state flow for global application data, specifically for Favorites and Filters.
* **Complex Data Filtering:** Features sophisticated filtering to narrow down meals based on user-selected criteria: **Gluten-Free**, **Lactose-Free**, **Vegetarian**, and **Vegan**.
* **Modular Architecture:** Codebase is structured with clear separation of concerns (Screens, Widgets, Models, Providers) to ensure scalability and ease of feature development.
* **Declarative UI with Theming:** Utilizes Flutter's built-in theming capabilities, including **Material 3** and `google_fonts`, for a consistent, visually appealing user interface.
* **Favorites Management:** Users can instantly add and remove meals from a dedicated 'Favorites' section with immediate feedback using snackbars.

## 🚀 Roadmap: Future Enhancements

These planned updates demonstrate forward-thinking development and knowledge of required modern app features:

* **Offline Data Persistence:** Integrate a local database (e.g., Hive or SQLite) to persist user-selected favorite meals and filters across application restarts.
* **Advanced Animations:** Implement hero animations and explicit controller-based animations (e.g., for the Favorites icon) to enhance the perceived performance and polish of the UI.
* **Universal Search Implementation:** Develop a performant, custom search delegate to allow users to search across both meal titles and ingredients simultaneously.
